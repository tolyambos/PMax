# Prisma Database Connection Fixes

## Problem Identified
We identified the root cause of the project retrieval issues in the PMax application. The primary issue was the missing `DATABASE_URL` environment variable, which prevented Prisma from connecting to the PostgreSQL database properly.

## Verification Steps
We performed the following steps to verify the solution:

1. Added the PostgreSQL connection URL to `.env.local`:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:57684/pmax"
   ```

2. Tested database connectivity with `npx prisma db push` - success
3. Created a database check script that successfully found 5 projects 
4. Created a tRPC test script that successfully retrieved all projects
5. Verified there are no serialization issues with JSON and SuperJSON

## Database Status
- Dev user exists in the database with ID `dev-user-id`
- 5 projects exist in the database with scenes
- All projects can be properly retrieved via direct Prisma access and tRPC

## Recommendations

1. **Environment Variables**: Ensure `.env.local` always contains the DATABASE_URL. Add this to your documentation and setup instructions.

2. **Project Creation/Retrieval**: The disconnect between project creation and retrieval was due to the missing database connection. With the connection fixed, projects can be properly created and retrieved.

3. **Error Recovery**: The fallback mechanisms in your codebase (finding recent projects, creating new ones if needed) provide good error recovery, but with the database connection fixed, they should rarely be needed.

4. **Development Setup**: Create a setup script that verifies the database connection and presence of the dev user on application startup.

5. **Debugging Tools**: The diagnostic scripts we created (`check-db.ts`, `test-trpc.ts`, `debug-serialization.ts`) should be kept as part of your development toolkit.

## Next Steps

1. Start the application again with `npm run dev`
2. Generate a new project through the UI
3. Verify the project can be retrieved in the editor
4. Check the browser console for any remaining errors

The application should now correctly persist and retrieve projects across page refreshes and browser sessions.
